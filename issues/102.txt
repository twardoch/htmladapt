Read the full codebase (or the @llms.txt codebase snapshot) and read @PLAN.md and @TODO.md and also read @REVIEW-GPT.md and @REVIEW-GEMI.md and then completely rewrite @PLAN.md so that it focuses on the necessary improvements to the codebase. Then translate that plan into a flat itemized task list in @TODO.md and then /work on implementing the improvements. Donâ€™t overcomplicate the code, keep it lean and performant!
