# Code Review: htmladapt

This review assesses the quality, structure, and maintainability of the `htmladapt` codebase. The analysis is based on the Python source files and associated tests.

## Overall Assessment

The `htmladapt` project is a well-structured and robust tool for HTML content extraction and merging. The codebase demonstrates a strong understanding of software engineering principles, with a clear separation of concerns, good test coverage, and a modular design that promotes extensibility. The use of a configuration object for managing processing parameters is a key strength, allowing for flexible and predictable behavior.

While the overall quality is high, there are several areas where the code could be improved to enhance robustness, maintainability, and adherence to best practices. These areas primarily relate to error handling, docstring consistency, and tight coupling in the LLM integration.

## Strengths

*   **Project Structure:** The project is logically organized into `core`, `algorithms`, `llm`, and `utils` modules. This clear separation makes the codebase easy to navigate and understand.
*   **Configuration Management:** The `ProcessingConfig` class provides an excellent mechanism for configuring the tool's behavior. The factory methods for different performance profiles (`fast`, `accurate`, `balanced`) are a particularly effective feature.
*   **Comprehensive Testing:** The project includes a solid suite of unit and integration tests that cover the main functionalities. This provides a good safety net for future refactoring and development.
*   **Modularity and Encapsulation:** Components like `IDGenerator`, `ElementMatcher`, and `HTMLParser` are well-encapsulated. This design promotes reusability and simplifies testing.
*   **Robust Parsing:** The `HTMLParser`'s fallback mechanism for different backends (`lxml`, `html5lib`, `html.parser`) makes the tool resilient to different environments and malformed HTML.
*   **Extensible Architecture:** The design allows for future enhancements, such as adding new matching strategies or integrating different LLM providers.

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. Inconsistent Docstrings

While most of the code is documented, the docstring format is inconsistent across the modules. Some docstrings follow a reStructuredText-like format, while others are more free-form.

**Recommendation:** Adopt a standard docstring format, such as the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#3.8-comments-and-docstrings), and apply it consistently. This will improve readability and enable automated documentation generation with tools like Sphinx.

### 2. Generic Exception Handling

The `extract` and `merge` methods in `HTMLExtractMergeTool` use a broad `except Exception` block. This can obscure the root cause of errors and make debugging more difficult.

**File:** `src/htmladapt/core/extractor_merger.py`

```python
def extract(self, html: str) -> tuple[str, str]:
    ...
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Extraction failed: {e}")
        raise
```

**Recommendation:** Catch more specific exceptions where possible (e.g., `ValueError` from the parser, `TypeError`) and provide more context in the error logs.

### 3. Tight Coupling in LLMReconciler

The `LLMReconciler` class is tightly coupled to the OpenAI API. This makes it difficult to switch to other LLM providers or use local models without modifying the class directly.

**File:** `src/htmladapt/llm/reconciler.py`

**Recommendation:** Introduce an abstract base class for the reconciler that defines a common interface. The `OpenAIReconciler` could then be one implementation of this interface. This would follow the Dependency Inversion Principle and make the system more flexible.

### 4. Missing Type Hint for `llm_reconciler`

The `llm_reconciler` parameter in `HTMLExtractMergeTool.__init__` is not type-hinted.

**File:** `src/htmladapt/core/extractor_merger.py`

```python
def __init__(
    self,
    config: ProcessingConfig | None = None,
    llm_reconciler=None  # Optional LLM integration
) -> None:
```

**Recommendation:** Define a base class for the reconciler as suggested above and use it to type-hint the `llm_reconciler` parameter.

```python
from htmladapt.llm.base import BaseReconciler

def __init__(
    self,
    config: ProcessingConfig | None = None,
    llm_reconciler: BaseReconciler | None = None
) -> None:
```

### 5. Hardcoded Weights in `ElementMatcher`

The `_calculate_similarity` method in `ElementMatcher` uses hardcoded weights to combine the different similarity scores.

**File:** `src/htmladapt/algorithms/matcher.py`

```python
def _calculate_similarity(self, elem1: Tag, elem2: Tag) -> float:
    ...
    combined_score = (
        id_score * 0.4 +
        hash_score * 0.3 +
        text_score * 0.2 +
        structure_score * 0.1
    )
```

**Recommendation:** Move these weights to the `ProcessingConfig` class to make them configurable. This would allow users to fine-tune the matching algorithm for their specific needs.

### 6. Potentially Redundant HTML Parsing

In the `HTMLExtractMergeTool.merge` method, `original_html` is parsed into `original_soup`, but `original_soup` is not used in the rest of the method. The merging logic seems to rely on `superset_soup`.

**Recommendation:** Review the `merge` method to determine if parsing `original_html` is necessary. If not, removing this step could provide a minor performance improvement.

## Actionable Recommendations

1.  **Standardize Docstrings:** Unify all docstrings to a single format (e.g., Google style).
2.  **Refactor Exception Handling:** Replace broad `except Exception` blocks in `HTMLExtractMergeTool` with more specific exception handling.
3.  **Abstract LLM Reconciler:** Create a `BaseReconciler` abstract class and update `LLMReconciler` to implement it. Update `HTMLExtractMergeTool` to use the new type hint.
4.  **Make Matcher Weights Configurable:** Move the similarity score weights from `ElementMatcher` to `ProcessingConfig`.
5.  **Review Parser Usage:** Investigate and potentially remove the parsing of `original_html` in the `merge` method if it is found to be redundant.
